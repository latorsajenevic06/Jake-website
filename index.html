      <h3>Graphic Artist</h3>
      <p>When I was in high school, I began learning how to edit videos and photos for school projects exclusively, but I never stopped there and I continue to learn more about editing to improve my ability.</p>

      <h3>Communication Skills</h3>
      <p>I've gained great communication skills from my work experience and training, and I can effectively communicate ideas to a variety of audiences. Additionally, I'm a good listener, which helps me truly understand a situation and determine the best action to take.</p>

     <img class="Teamwork skills" src="images/teamwork.jpg" alt="Teamwork-img">
      <h3>Teamwork Skill</h3>
      <p>At my current job, I improve my teamwork skills. I've always had a teamwork mentality because I firmly think that no man is an island and that in order to come up with the best solution or idea, we must all work together.</p>

     <img class="Time Management skills" src="images/time management.png" alt="Time Management-img">
      <h3>Time Management Skills</h3>
      <p>I value meeting deadlines, therefore I use project management software to keep track of every work I have and when it is due. I add new projects to my software list as they arise and note the deadline, which helps me prioritize tasks that need to be finished before others on my to-do list. For ease of completion in the days preceding the deadline, I also divide ambitious undertakings into smaller, more doable jobs.</p>
